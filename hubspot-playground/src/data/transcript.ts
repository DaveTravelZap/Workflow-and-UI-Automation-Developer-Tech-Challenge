    "Robin Everman: Thank you for calling, this is Robin Everman with Destify. I see you're interested in our destination wedding services. Could you tell me a little bit about what you're dreaming of?\n\nCindy Gardner: Hi, yes, thank you. My fiancé and I are looking to get married sometime next year, around late spring or early summer, and we really want a destination wedding. We've been looking at places in the Caribbean, maybe Mexico, but we're open to suggestions!\n\nRobin Everman: That sounds lovely! Late spring/early summer is a beautiful time of year for a tropical wedding. So, for the date, is there a specific month you're leaning toward, like maybe May or June?\n\nCindy Gardner: We're thinking early June is ideal. We're a bit flexible though, maybe a week or two either way.\n\nRobin Everman: Got it. And what about the size of the wedding? Do you have an estimate for your guest count?\n\nCindy Gardner: We're hoping for something intimate, maybe 30 to 50 guests, including us.\n\nRobin Everman: Intimate weddings are our specialty. That size gives us a lot of flexibility with venue selection. Now, let's talk location. You mentioned the Caribbean and Mexico. Are there any must-haves for the location? For example, are you looking for a resort that is adults-only, family-friendly, or a private villa?\n\nCindy Gardner: We're hoping for something with a great beach for the ceremony, but maybe a private feel for the reception. We'd prefer an adults-only resort or a private villa if possible. Somewhere with good food and activities for the guests would be a plus.\n\nRobin Everman: Excellent. We have a few properties that fit that description perfectly, including Place in Riviera Maya and Place in Jamaica. Are you interested in reviewing a preliminary package for either of those?\n\nCindy Gardner: Yes, definitely. I'd love to see what you offer.\n\nRobin Everman: Wonderful. Lastly, do you have a tentative budget range in mind for the entire planning and execution? This helps us narrow down the best options immediately.\n\nCindy Gardner: We don't have an exact range in mind, but we're middle of the road. Nothing too fancy, but better than economy.. not including flights for the guests.\n\nRobin Everman: Thank you for sharing that. I will put together a preliminary proposal featuring 2-3 tailored options, including the locations we discussed. I'll send it over to you by the end of the day, and then we can schedule a follow-up call to review it. How does that sound?\n\nCindy Gardner: That sounds great, thank you so much!\n\nRobin Everman: My pleasure. You'll receive the proposal in an email. I'll include a link to schedule our next call there too. Have a great day.",
